Create an application on Reddit (developer settings under your user settings).

After you create the app, `yarn install` and then create an .env file that looks like this:

```
CLIENT_ID=YourAppID
CLIENT_SECRET=YourAppSecret
REDDIT_USER=UsernameForAppAccount
REDDIT_PASS=PasswordForAppAccount
```

Run with `node app.js`.
